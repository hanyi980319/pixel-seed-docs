# Pixel Seed: Web-based AI-native Game Engine for Procedural Pixel Art Generation

## Abstract

This paper presents Pixel Seed, a web-based AI-native game engine designed for procedural pixel art generation in platformer games. Traditional game development workflows face significant constraints including engine-centric limitations, high content production overhead, and fragmented AI integration pipelines. Pixel Seed addresses these challenges by providing a unified, prompt-driven platform that seamlessly integrates AI image generation with real-time gameplay mechanics. The system enables dynamic world-building through natural language prompts, offering personalized gaming experiences while maintaining the aesthetic constraints of pixel art. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of web-based AI-native game engines and provides a foundation for future research in AI-assisted game development.

**Keywords:** AI-native game engine, procedural generation, pixel art, web-based gaming, prompt-driven design
