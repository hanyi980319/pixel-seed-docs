# 1. Introduction 引言

## 1.1 Summary —— 项目概述

### Project Background

Pixel Seed is an innovative web-based AI-native game engine designed to revolutionize the creation and experience of pixel art platformer games. In an era where artificial intelligence is transforming creative industries, game development remains largely constrained by traditional engine-centric workflows that separate content creation from gameplay mechanics.

### Core Innovation

The project introduces a paradigm shift from conventional game development approaches by:

- **Integrating AI as a first-class citizen** in the game engine architecture
- **Eliminating the traditional asset pipeline** through real-time AI generation
- **Enabling prompt-driven world creation** that democratizes game development
- **Providing instant playability** of AI-generated content
